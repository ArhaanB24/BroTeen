                            specific days to work different muscle groups. It typically includes training one major
                            muscle group per day over the course of a week. This
                            approach allows for focused and intense training sessions for each muscle group, often
                            favored by individuals
                            primarily seeking muscle growth and aesthetics. Bro split is also one of the most famous

                            characterized by its focus on compound movements and progressive overload. It
                            involves three workouts per week. Each session begins with a main lift, followed by a
                            secondary lift with lower volume. There's an alternating approach where the final
                            set's weight increases each session for upper body lifts, and the first set's weight
                            increases for lower body lifts. </p>

                        <p class="card-text"> GVT is an intense hypertrophy-focused program that involves performing ten
                            sets of ten repetitions for a single compound exercise. The high volume and short rest
                            periods stimulate muscle growth and endurance. It's considered an advanced program due to
                            its demanding nature. The sheer volume of work places substantial stress on the targeted
                            muscle groups, leading to muscle fiber recruitment and growth. </p>
